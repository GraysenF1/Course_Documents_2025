- Canadiana (not quite sure what it fits under so put it down here). Canadiana is essentially a massive repository containing heritage content about Canada that has been digitized. Thanks to Canadiana, it is made available free of charge and online to anybody who wants to use it. https://www.crkn-rcdr.ca/en/canadiana was used as a basis for information, and I also browsed the Canadiana website a bit as well.
