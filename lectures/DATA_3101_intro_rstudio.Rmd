## Why use R?

-   Widely used in Open Science to write and share reproducible code
-   Also used in DATA 3001 Data Visualization and Communication
-   A good challenge for Computer Science students in this interdisciplinary course - the more tools you know, the better! You can then evaluate which suits your needs depending on your project partners.

## R Tour

When you open R, it will have 3 areas:

-   Console / Terminal: You can run code in the console. For example, installing packages is usually done in the console.

-   Environment / History / Connections / Git / Tutorial pane: This is where you can see the objects you've created and commit your files to GitHub.

-   Files / Plot / Packages / Help / Viewer / Presentation pane: Navigate your files and find help and documentation.

**Check-in question**: What version of R is running on your computer?

Please let me know if you ever have problems reading the code in class. I can easily zoom in.

Zooming in and out is done with keyboard shortcuts:

-   Zoom in: Cmd/Ctrl +

-   Zoom out: Cmd/Ctrl -

## Using R like a calculator in the console

-   Test arithmetic and order of operations
    -   Parentheses: ()
    -   Exponents: \^ or \*\*
    -   Multiply: \*
    -   Divide: /
    -   Add: +
    -   Subtract: -
-   Cancel an incomplete command by hitting Esc in the Console window

**Check-in question**: How does R indicate that is ready for the next command?

## R Script files, R Notebook files, and Quarto documents

When you create a file in your RStudio project, you have a few choices.

For reproducible code, often you'll choose an R script file (file extension .R).

Common choices for a mixture of code and text are an R notebook (file extension: .Rmd), or a Quarto document.

Most of my past course content was created as R notebooks (.Rmd files) because they are the way I learned how to combine markup text with code. I set the output of my file to github_document to create .md files that can be easily read in GitHub.

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a more modern, multi-language approach to creating this type of document. The second edition of *R for Data Science* includes a [chapter on Quarto](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html) instead of content on R notebooks. Over this term, I'll be switching to using Quarto.

# Today: Compare Quarto documents and R script files

Open your DATA 3101 RStudio project.

### Quarto Document

Go to File -\> New File -\> Quarto Document and create a new Quarto document, selecting the html option.

Change the output to gfm. This stands for GitHub flavoured markdown.

Give it the title Assignment 1.

Copy and paste the question you added to the README file to this document. Leave the default code chunks in the file for now. Save it as DATA_3101_assignment1. Save and render the file. Commit and push both the .qmd and .md file to GitHub.

### R Script

Go to File -\> New File -\> R Script and create a new R Script file. Save it as dplyr_flight_example.R

This is the file we'll start working with in the next lecture.
