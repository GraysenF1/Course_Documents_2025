## Learning objectives

At the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:

-   Demonstrate in depth understanding of the principles, motivations and goals for reproducible, ethical, and open data

-   Use Git for communication and reproducible version control

-   Import and tidy diverse data sources across platforms

-   Explore data to identify potential research questions or problems in the dataset

-   Identify best practices for research data management, including data organization, storage, security, sharing, and ethical re-use

-   Demonstrate what they have learned about data acquisition, data organization, and data tools through self-reflection

## Tools: Git & RStudio

-   One of the themes throughout this course is the importance of reproducibility and open data
-   RStudio: import, tidy, analyze, and communicate data using a reproducible workflow
-   RStudio can be linked with Git for version control
-   Many of the good practices in research data management can be demonstrated using these tools (importance of file naming, file structures, documentation, version control)

## Practice and Learning

## CEWIL Project

- CEWIL = Co-operative Education and Work-Integrated Learning
- We will be working on a data project to support Open Access publications 
- We will acquire the data through webscraping and transform it to meet the requirements of the Open Journal Systems' import plugin
- We will use both R and Artificial Intelligence text analysis approaches
- You will have access to ChatGPT Team (data analysis, file uploads, web browsing) supported through the CEWIL grant
- You will receive a stipend
