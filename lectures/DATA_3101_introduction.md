## Learning objectives

At the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:

- Demonstrate in depth understanding of the principles, motivations and
  goals for reproducible, ethical, and open data

- Use Git for communication and reproducible version control

- Import and tidy diverse data sources across platforms

- Explore data to identify potential research questions or problems in
  the dataset

- Identify best practices for research data management, including data
  organization, storage, security, sharing, and ethical re-use

- Demonstrate what they have learned about data acquisition, data
  organization, and data tools through self-reflection

## Tools: Git & RStudio

- One of the themes throughout this course is the importance of
  reproducibility and open data
- RStudio: import, tidy, analyze, and communicate data using a
  reproducible workflow
- RStudio can be linked with Git for version control
- Many of the good practices in research data management can be
  demonstrated using these tools (importance of file naming, file
  structures, documentation, version control)
