This term, Mount Allison is participating in a trial for
[Constellate](https://constellate-org.libproxy.mta.ca/), a text and data
analysis platform.

This may work for an alternative to installing RStudio and getting Git
running on a computer. Sometimes students do not have admin permissions
on a laptop running MacOS or Windows.

Here is what you we can try in that case:

1.  Go to [Constellate](https://constellate-org.libproxy.mta.ca/)
2.  Set up a [JSTOR account](https://constellate.org/docs/log-in) using
    your MtA email account
3.  Click on Open Your Lab
4.  Select RStudio
5.  Create a New Project: Version Control
6.  Associate this with your GitHub repository

Of possible interest to all students in this course: [Constellate Skill
