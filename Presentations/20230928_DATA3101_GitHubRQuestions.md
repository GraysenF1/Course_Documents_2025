## R Markdown Presentation

I'm trying something new for 2023 - creating ioslides presentations in R Markdown. Although these aren't beautiful like slides made with Canva templates, I will be able to embed R code chunks that will run.

Another advantage will be version control. Instead of uploading new PDFs of the PowerPoint files, I will revise existing files. 

## GitHub and R Setup Issues

-   Stregger: solved my M2 Mac problem by setting up SSH keys instead of using PAT
-   Committing work to test repository instead of organizational repository (solution: clone organizational repository, move files)
-   Text in commit space instead of inside files (solution: demo & check)

## Question

-   What file format is preferred?
