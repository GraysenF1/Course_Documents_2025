TA: Sabrina Sandy

## Course description:

This course will build on MATH 1311 to cover high throughput acquisition and management of data. The course will use diverse data types and formats to illustrate conceptual challenges across disciplines.
Technical aspects will include evolving approaches to script-based web scraping, file formats and conversions, data mergers and tidying, metadata organization and capture. In parallel, the course will cover theoretical and ethical aspects of data curation and access policies, development of best practices for research data management and case studies in secure management of sensitive or private data.

# Course Policies

## Grading

Grades are extrinsic (external) motivators and often do not measure
student learning over time. Ungrading is a way to shift the focus away from marks and towards increasing skills and understanding throughout the term. I have designed this course with the flexibility for you to continue learning and improving your work based on my feedback. This feedback will the take the form of suggestions, questions, and resources to guide your revision. This fits particularly well with the theme of version control and documentation that runs through this course.

You will be asked to submit your code after participatory live coding in the classroom. Once we have talked about documenting code and you have developed more familiarity with R, you will have a chance to revise this work.

You will be building a portfolio of your work in GitHub. We will meet one-on-one partway through the term to talk about your learning goals and progress in the class. I will provide questions to help you with self-evaluation. We will work together to decide on a mid-term grade based on your first draft work and a final grade based on your revised work.

## Due dates

Due dates are included in the syllabus so that we can plan our work. Up to 5 grace days are available to each student. Work submitted later than 5 days after the due date will not be assessed, unless this is an approved accommodation. It is difficult to meet the course learning objectives if you habitually submit work late.

## Recordings

This class will be held in person. However, if you are feeling unwell, please stay home. Lectures will be recorded for accessibility and made available through
[Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3AYGAXk7kTjbxKMNEnlsNeWs5VY9SNxWd-gTehhIcxhHI1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=2b4f9b50-a3c6-4a77-87fa-3b1f5c4ae3b7&tenantId=8c4dd588-ca00-4338-b4ad-10719f15598d).

## Artificial Intelligence

This course is designed for in-person experiential learning.
Research data management best practices are integrated throughout the course material. One of these is the importance of documentation, whether that is documenting code or documenting your learning through version history in GitHub. This class is assessed using ungrading, which means documenting and reflecting on your learning is a core skill.

Using Generative AI is not the most way straightforward way to learn in this class. If you do choose to use tools like Copilot or ChatGPT, you can demonstrate the learning objectives in the class by thoroughly documenting your usage as part of each assignment. Examples are available in the course materials. 

Lack of disclosure of AI usage at the time of submission is a failure to engage with core learning objectives of the course. The maximum course grade available through ungrading will be a C. Each further infraction will further decrease the grades open for discussion.

Please never panic and submit AI-generated work. Deadline extensions, help with your coursework, and alternative formats can be arranged.

## Names and pronouns

Elizabeth Stregger uses they and she pronouns. You can address me as Elizabeth (preferred) or Mx. Stregger. If you let me know what pronouns you use, I will strive to use them. I am also committed to pronouncing your name properly. I might not get it right on the first try or all the time. Please feel confident to correct me and I will work to improve.
