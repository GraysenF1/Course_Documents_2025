TA: Sabrina Sandy

## Course description:

This course will build on MATH 1311 to cover high throughput acquisition and management of data. The course will use diverse data types and formats to illustrate conceptual challenges across disciplines.
Technical aspects will include evolving approaches to script-based web scraping, file formats and conversions, data mergers and tidying, metadata organization and capture. In parallel, the course will cover theoretical and ethical aspects of data curation and access policies, development of best practices for research data management and case studies in secure management of sensitive or private data.

#### Ungrading Meetings outside of class time

# Course Policies

## Grading

Grades are extrinsic (external) motivators and often do not measure
student learning over time. Ungrading is a way to shift the focus away from marks and towards increasing skills and understanding throughout the term. I have designed this course with the flexibility for you to continue learning and improving your work based on my feedback. This feedback will the take the form of suggestions, questions, and resources to guide your revision. This fits particularly well with the theme of version control and documentation that runs through this course.

You will be asked to submit your code after participatory live coding in the classroom. Once we have talked about documenting code and you have developed more familiarity with R, you will have a chance to revise this work.

You will be building a portfolio of your work in GitHub. We will meet one-on-one partway through the term to talk about your learning goals and progress in the class. I will provide questions to help you with self-evaluation. We will work together to decide on a mid-term grade based on your first draft work and a final grade based on your revised work.

## Due dates

Due dates are included in the syllabus so that we can plan our work. You do not need to tell me if your work will be late. However, any work submitted later than 5 days after the due date will not be assessed in time for you to receive feedback and continue to develop your work. It is difficult to meet the course learning objectives if you habitually submit work late.

## Recordings

This class will be held in person. However, if you are feeling unwell, please stay home. Lectures will be recorded for accessibility and made available through
[Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3AI7TKF3BPoR70ajZFC7ebuO_hIpi9Op1kn0nUEXZhdVA1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=be497ae2-363d-4abf-9cc4-c1290d0fd2a9&tenantId=).

## Artificial Intelligence



## Names and pronouns

Elizabeth Stregger uses they and she pronouns. You can address me as Elizabeth (preferred) or Mx. Stregger. If you let me know what pronouns you use, I will strive to use them. I am also committed to pronouncing your name properly. I might not get it right on the first try or all the time. Please feel confident to correct me and I will work to improve.
