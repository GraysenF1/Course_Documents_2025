Data Management Plan:

Read the data management plan template that is most closely aligned with the topic of the data you chose for the Find Data and/or OpenRefine assignment.

Pretending you are the researcher, create a data management plan for the data set you've examined in previous assignments. Include notes or questions you'd need to answer, as I did in the tick data example.

Download the data management plan, put it in your personal repository on your computer, and push it to GitHub.

Create an issue to let me know it is ready for feedback.

This is an assignment we'll return to at the end of the course and improve.
