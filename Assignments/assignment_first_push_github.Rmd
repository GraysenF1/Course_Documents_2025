## First Push to GitHub

### Purpose

-   make sure that your setup for the course is working as expected

-   contribute to our conversation about version control

### Reminder

We went over this process in class. Instructions are provided here in case as a reminder.

Join the MtADATA3101 GitHub Organization. An email invitation was sent to the email address you used to set up your GitHub account. Remember to check that email for notifications if you set up GitHub with a non-MtA account!

Create a version control project in RStudio and link it to your personal repository in MtADATA3101. Follow the the steps in section [15.2.2](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first#rstudio-ide) of Happy Git and GitHub for the UseR to find the README.md file.

If you encounter any problems, make an appointment with Elizabeth.

### Assignment

From RStudio, open the README file in your MtADATA3101 personal repository and answer this question:

What is one question you have about GitHub, based on your experience so far or the article by Bryan (2017)?

[Make local changes, save, commit](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first#make-local-changes-save-commit-1)

[Push your local changes to GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first#push-your-local-changes-to-github)

[Confirm the local change propagated to the GitHub Remote](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first#confirm-the-local-change-propagated-to-the-github-remote-2) (your personal repository in MtADATA3101)
