Working on CEWIL project with Team GPT and R: Reflection

Tell me what you thought about using Team GPT in this course.

Here are some questions to help you get started:

- Do you think a custom instruction like ExplainLikeImFive would help
  you learn in a class like this one? How did/would you use it?

- Did you compare GPT-4.0 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for any tasks? How were
  the responses different?

- Would you use AI to solve a coding problem or to do repetitive work?
  If so, how?

- What do you find satisfying about working with AI? With R?

- What would you tell a first or second year student about generative AI
  and learning?

You can write in point form or set up a meeting time to talk about it if
you’d rather not write. The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate
the tools you’ve used in this course. It’s very helpful to hear from
students about generative AI and if or how you want to use it.
