## Research a term relevant to the CEWIL project

During the two introductory talks about CRKN and PIDs, I made a list of
acronyms and subject-specific terms weâ€™ll be using with this community
partner.

The [CEWIL glossary
list](https://github.com/MtADATA3101/Course_Documents_2025/blob/main/cewil_glossary.qmd)
is now available in the DATA 3101 repository as a Quarto markdown
document.

Search for one of the terms that has not been added yet. (Hint: for
organizations, search for the organization and read their about page.
For concepts, use any of the listed organizations or a site connected to
a university).

Explain or define the term in a couple of sentences. If you use a direct
quote, remember to use quotation marks. Provide the source of the
information as a link.

## GitHub Desktop and Pull Requests

Go to the [2025_cewil_crkn_project
repository](https://github.com/estregger/2025_cewil_crkn_project/blob/main/install_workshop.md)
and complete the following steps:

- Install GitHub Desktop

- Set up communication between GitHub desktop and GitHub

- Create a tutorial repository

- Connect to a repository owned by someone else

This repository was created to help students in the CHEM/BIOC class get
set up for the CEWIL project. By the time you finish step 6, you should
be able to create a pull request to modify the CEWIL glossary.
