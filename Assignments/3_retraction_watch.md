Assignment 3
================

## Retraction Watch (due Sep. 26)

### Purpose:

- Describe a data problem in published research
- Suggest a research data management practice that may have prevented
  the retraction

### Assignment:

Choose a retracted article from the [Retraction Watch
Database](http://retractionwatchdatabase.org), using the filter
“Concerns about data” or “Error in data” or “Unreliable data.”

Note: examples that don’t include falsified data are usually more
interesting!

Read the Retraction Watch blog article (if available), and the
retraction notice (if available). In your own words, write a description
of the problem with the data.

Which step of the research data lifecycle would you identify as the
place where these researchers had problems? Is there a best practice
that would have led to a correction instead of a retraction?

Save the file with a descriptive name. Push it to your repository.

### Ideas for A range work:

- Did the journal retraction notice meet the [COPE Retraction
  Guidelines](https://publicationethics.org/retraction-guidelines) for a
  notice of retraction? Was there anything missing and did it make it
  hard to answer the assignment question?

- Go beyond the expectation of linking to the original article,
  retraction notice, and *Retraction Watch* blog post (if available) by
  including citations for all three. Let me know which citation standard
  you followed, and if you used a tool like Zotero or BibTex to create
  them.
