This file includes assignments for DATA 3101. The file naming convention is YYYYMMDD_DATA3101_Topic

YYYYMMDD follows ISO 8601, an international standard for communication of date and time related data. Following ISO 8601 and explaining that you've used this standard is an example of choosing an interoperable data standard. It is a particularly helpful format because it is easy to sort files by date when this is included in the filename.

For 2023, the date YYYYMMDD indicates the due date.

For example, 20230921_PushtoGitHub.rmd is an assignment due on September 21 2023.
