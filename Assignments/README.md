This folder includes current and past assignments for DATA 3101.

TL;DR (too long, didn't read): Current assignments start with assignment_

Instead of deleting old versions of assignments, I've left them here as an example of a poorly chosen file naming convention.

In 2023, the file naming convention was YYYYMMDD, where this date indicated the due date.

YYYYMMDD follows ISO 8601, an international standard for communication of date and time related data. Following ISO 8601 and explaining that you've used this standard is an example of choosing an interoperable data standard. It is a particularly helpful format because it is easy to sort files by date when this is included in the filename.

For example, 20230921_PushtoGitHub.rmd was an assignment due on September 21 2023.
