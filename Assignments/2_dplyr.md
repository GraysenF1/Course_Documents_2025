2025-09-01

## Due: September 19, 2025

### Purpose:

- Share work from participatory live coding
- Practice pushing to GitHub
- Create a file that will be updated in a future version control
  assignment

### Assignment:

At the beginning of class on September 18, create a new R script file or
R Notebook.

Code along with Elizabeth to practice using dplyr functions.

Save the file with a descriptive name including the term dplyr. Push it
to your repository.

### Ideas for A range work:

- include notes, comments on errors or things that didnâ€™t work, and/or
  questions

- complete some or all of the exercises in section [3.2.5 of
  R4DS](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform#exercises) as extra
  practice and skill-building, especially for those who already have
  intermediate R skills

### Reminder about AI usage:

If you used AI for this assignment, include a description of how you used it in the text of your GitHub issue. What tool did you use? Why? Was it helpful? Take screenshots showing your prompt(s) and the output(s), or find a way to export and share usage with Elizabeth. Remember that undocumented AI usage is against the course policies.
