## First post to GitHub: Due September 21

The purpose of this assignment is to make sure that your setup for the course is working as expected.

Join the MtADATA3101 GitHub Organization. An email invitation was sent to the email address you used to set up your GitHub account. Remember to check that email for notifications if you set up GitHub with a non-MtA account!

Create a version control project in RStudio and link it to your personal repository in MtADATA3101. Follow the the steps in section 15.2.2 of Happy Git and GitHub for the UseR.

Open the README file in R and respond to this prompt:
What is one question you have about GitHub?

Save the changes to your file. 
Pull any changes from GitHub.
Select your file in the Git pane of RStudio and commit it.
Push your changes to GitHub.
