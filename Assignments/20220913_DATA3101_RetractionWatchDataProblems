Choose a retracted article from the Retraction Watch Database, using the filter “Concerns about data” or “Error in data” or “Unreliable data”
Note: examples that don’t include falsified data are usually more interesting!
Read the Retraction Watch blog article (if available), and the retraction notice (if available)
In your own words, write a description of the problem with the data. Which step of the research data lifecycle would you identify as the place where these researchers had problems?
Create a new version control project in RStudio, linked to your personal repository
Go to File – New File – R Markdown
Give the file a human readable filename (can have spaces here)
Add the text you created in Part 1 to the bottom of the bottom of the default text
Save with a machine-readable filename (no spaces!)
Go to Settings – Output Options – Advanced
Check ”Keep markdown source file”
Knit 
In the Git pane, stage the new folder, commit, and push

Goals for this assignment: identifying data problems in published scholarship, understanding where researchers could improve their research data management, testing GitHub repository setup
