## Due: September 11, 2025

### Purpose

- make sure that your setup for the course is working as expected

- contribute to our conversation about version control

- start communicating using GitHub

### Reminder

We went over this process in class. Instructions in this section are a reminder in case you missed a step.

Join the MtADATA3101 GitHub Organization. An email invitation was sent
to the email address you used to set up your GitHub account. Remember to
check that email for notifications if you set up GitHub with a non-MtA
account.

Create a version control project in RStudio and link it to your personal
repository in MtADATA3101. Follow the the steps in section
[15.2.2](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first#rstudio-ide) of
Happy Git and GitHub for the UseR to find the README.md file.

If you encounter any problems, make an appointment with Elizabeth.

### Assignment

From RStudio, open the README file in your MtADATA3101 personal
repository and answer this question:

What is one question you have about GitHub, based on your experience so
far or the article by Bryan (2017)?
