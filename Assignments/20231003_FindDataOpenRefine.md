**Find Data and Explore in OpenRefine**

Look for 1-2 datasets that interest you for use throughout this class. You will use these data to practice research data management skills.

Add a link to the dataset(s) in GitHub. Explain why the dataset(s) are of interest to you.

Download the data files. What format are these files? Can you open them in OpenRefine?

Reminder: OpenRefine can open tab separatedÂ ( tsv ), comma separated ( csv ), Excel ( xls , xlsx ), JSON, XML, RDF as XML, and Google Spreadsheets.

If not, find a different dataset for this assignment.

Import a data file from the dataset you chose into OpenRefine. Facet, filter, and cluster some of the columns. Are there any data problems to be corrected? Do you have questions about the dataset? Write a summary and add it to your repository.
