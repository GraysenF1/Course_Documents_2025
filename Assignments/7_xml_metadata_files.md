Assignment 7: Metadata files
================

Due: November 14, 2024

Task: Use the “Extract metadata and add file” prompt in Team-GPT to
generate the XML records for a volume of *Theory and Applications of
Categories*.

Volume assignments:

Jamie: v. 41

Ruth: v. 40

Duc Tri: v. 39

Nawfal: v. 38

Syed: v. 37

J-P: v. 36

Amber: v. 35

Lance: v. 34

Nicholas: v. 33

Ben: v. 32

Deep: v. 31

Luis: v. 30

### Main option:

Copy the HTML for each article into the “Extract metadata and add file”
prompt in Team-GPT. Create a text file (with extension txt in RStudio)
and copy the XML output records to that file. Include at least 18
articles from your volume in the file.

Commit and push the file to GitHub.

### Alternative approach:

Create a Python script to scrape the journal HTML and output it in the
required XML format (using the example XML files from the data folder
and the description of the process from the prompt used in Team GPT).
Upload the XML output(s) for your volume.

### For A-range work after completing the main option or the alternative assignment:

Log in to the [Open Journal System Test
Drive](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/ojs/demo/) journal. Create and
publish the issue (which is a volume in this case) that you have worked
on. Use the Native XML Plugin to import your txt file. Do you get any
error messages? If so, take a screenshot or copy them into an assignment
file. Go back to the public view of the journal and see if your articles
display correctly. Take a screenshot of the volume to show that it the
import succeeded. Submit the screenshot(s) as part of your assignment.
