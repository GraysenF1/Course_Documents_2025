## Assignment 6: Update Week 5 code

In RStudio, open the script file you deposited with week 5 code.

Install the styler package if you have not already installed it. Agree
to any pop-up messages about changes.

Using the styler addin, choose “style active file” and save the file.
Commit and push the file to GitHub. Look at the file versioning to see
if there are any changes.
