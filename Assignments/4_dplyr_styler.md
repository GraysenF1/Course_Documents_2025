Assignment 4
================

## Update code from DPLYR live-coding, using styler (due Sep. 26)

### Purpose:

- Share work from participatory live coding

- Practice pushing from RStudio to GitHub

- Resubmit updated dplyr coding file to see version control process in
  GitHub

### **Assignment:**

#### Part 1: Update your live coding and submit to GitHub

At the beginning of class on Sep. 24, open a new R script file. At the
end of class, save it without changing the file name, commit it, and
push it to your GitHub repository.

#### Part 2: Install styler and apply it to your dplyr file

[Styler](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/styler-1.0.0/) is a
package to format R code. This is like a style guide, and you can adapt
it.

Open your dplyr file in RStudio and install styler. Follow the
instructions in the screenshot at the styler link to use the Addin to
style your dplyr file. Save your file again without changing the file
name, commit it, and push it to your GitHub repository.

#### Part 3: Describe changes to your file

Go to your personal repository on GitHub. Look at the history of your
file. Did applying styler make any changes to your file?

Open your dplyr assignment file. Add a brief reflection on the changes
to your file. Did applying styler make any changes to your coding? Did
you accidentally change the name of your file and lose your history? How
have these first two sessions of live coding in R been for you (in terms
of pace, the textbook, questions, etc.)? Is there anything that I can do
to improve your experience?

Save your file again without changing the file name, commit it, and push
it your GitHub repository.
