Assignment 4
================

## Update code from DPLYR live-coding, using styler (due Sep. 26)

### Purpose:

- Share work from participatory live coding

- Practice pushing from RStudio to GitHub

- Resubmit updated dplyr coding file to see version control process in
  GitHub

### **Assignment:**

#### Part 1: Update your live coding and submit to GitHub

At the beginning of class on Sep. 23, make sure you have saved dplyr_flight_example.R and pushed it to GitHub. 

At the end of class, commit it again, and push it to your GitHub repository.

#### Part 2: Install styler and apply it to your dplyr file

[Styler](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/styler-1.0.0/) is a
package to format R code. This is like a style guide, and you can adapt
it.

Open your dplyr_flight_example.R file in RStudio and install styler. Follow the instructions in the screenshot at the styler link to use the Addin to
style your dplyr file. Save your file again with the same file
name, commit it, and push it to your GitHub repository.

#### Part 3: Describe changes to your file

Go to your personal repository on GitHub. Look at the history of your
file. Did applying styler make any changes to your file?

Create a new Quarto file called assignment_3_dplyr.qmd. Edit the output format to gfm so that it renders to github-flavoured markdown.

Add a brief reflection on the changes
to your file. Did applying styler make any changes to your coding? Did
you accidentally change the name of your file and lose your history? How
have these first two sessions of live coding in R been for you (in terms
of pace, the textbook, questions, etc.)? Is there anything that I can do to improve your experience?

Save your qmd file, render it, and commit it both the qmd and md files to your GitHub repository.

Create a new GitHub issue and assign it to estregger to let me know that you have completed the assignment.
