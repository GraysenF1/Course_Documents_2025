Save the R script files or R notebook files (your choice of file format) you create in classes on data tidying and data import in R.

Recordings of these live coding workshops are available in [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aF7EJE8821vYab3Uw3D55AI6YyaaruzdtQO4JWrh7A-k1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=45bbccb4-d876-4473-8ecf-55f0c88141d3&tenantId=8c4dd588-ca00-4338-b4ad-10719f15598d)

If you are not able to attend class, you’re expected to code along with the recorded class material to create these files. The recordings may also be useful if you’re having challenges understanding the content (though I encourage you to let me know if you have questions or problems).

Submit these files to your personal repository in GitHub by October 10.
