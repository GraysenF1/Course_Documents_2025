**OpenRefine Assignment**

Download the data files you chose in the Finding Data class. What format are these files? Can you open them in OpenRefine?

Reminder: OpenRefine can open tab separatedÂ ( tsv ), comma separated ( csv ), Excel ( xls , xlsx ), JSON, XML, RDF as XML, and Google Spreadsheets.

If not, find a different dataset for this assignment.

Import a data file from the dataset you chose into OpenRefine. Facet, filter, and cluster some of the columns. Are there any data problems to be corrected? Do you have questions about the dataset? Write a summary and add it to your repository.
