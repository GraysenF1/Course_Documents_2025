Pretending you are the researcher, create a data management plan for the data set you've examined in previous assignments. Include notes or questions you'd need to answer, as I did in the tick data example.

Download the data management plan, put it in your personal repository on your computer, and push it to GitHub.

This is an assignment we'll return to at the end of the course and improve.
