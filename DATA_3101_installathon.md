## Install Day

Today we’re starting to work on the learning objective “use Git for
communication and reproducible version control.”

We are working through the steps in [Happy Git and GitHub for the
useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) by Jenny Bryan and her team. (If
you’re super into stats, you might want to check out her openly
published grad-level [STAT 545](https://stat545.com/index.html) course
from UBC for some more advanced R analysis.)

Our goal is to work through the following steps from Happy Git:

5.  [Install or upgrade R and
    RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio)
6.  [Install Git](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git)
7.  [Introduce yourself to Git](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git)

<!-- -->

9.  [Personal access token for
    HTTPS](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat)
10. [Set up keys for SSH](https://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys) (not
    necessary if step 9 worked for you)
11. [Connect to GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github)
12. [Connect RStudio to Git and
    GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github)

<!-- -->

15. [New project, GitHub
    first](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first)

Let’s set up the classroom by operating system so that you can help each
other other. Step 6 (Install Git) has some operating system differences.

Both asking and answering questions is a great contribution (the kind of
thing we’ll talk about in ungrading meetings!). I learn something new
every year.
