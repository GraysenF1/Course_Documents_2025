# Course description

This course will build on MATH 1311 to cover high throughput acquisition and management of data. The course will use diverse data types and formats to illustrate conceptual challenges across disciplines. Technical aspects will include evolving approaches to script-based web scraping, file formats and conversions, data mergers and tidying, meta-data organization and capture. In parallel, the course will cover theoretical and ethical aspects of data curation and access policies, development of best practices for research data management and case studies in secure management of sensitive or private data.

# Learning objectives  
  
At the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:  

Demonstrate in depth understanding of the principles, motivations and goals for reproducible, ethical, and open data

Use Git for communication and reproducible version control  

Import and tidy diverse data sources across platforms  

Explore data to identify potential research questions or problems in the dataset  
Identify best practices for research data management, including data organization, storage, security, sharing, and ethical re-use  
 
Demonstrate what they have learned about data acquisition, data organization, and data tools through self-reflection

# Grading

Grades are extrinsic (external) motivators and often do not measure student learning over time. Ungrading is a way to shift the focus away from marks and towards increasing skills and understanding throughout the term. I have designed this course with the flexibility for you to continue learning and improving your work based on my feedback. This feedback will the take the form of suggestions, questions, and resources to guide your revision. This fits particularly well with the theme of version control and documentation that runs through this course. 

One example is the Data Management Plan (DMP) assignment. This assignment has a first due date of October 12. Based on my feedback and what you learn in weeks 7-11, you will be able to continue to add to this plan, with the final DMP due on November 21. 

Likewise, you will be asked to submit your code after participatory live coding in the classroom. Once we have talked about documenting code and you have developed more familiarity with R, you will have a chance to revise this work.  

You will be building a portfolio of your work in GitHub. We will meet one-on-one partway through the term to talk about your learning goals and progress in the class. I will provide questions to help you with self-evaluation. We will work together to decide on a mid-term grade based on your first draft work and a final grade based on your revised work. 

# Course policies

## Due dates
Due dates are included in the syllabus so that we can plan our work. You do not need to tell me if your work will be late. However, any work submitted later than 5 days after the due date will not be assessed in time for you to receive feedback and continue to develop your work. It is difficult to meet the course learning objectives if you habitually submit work late.

## Covid considerations
This class will be held in person. However, if you are feeling unwell, please stay home. Lectures will be recorded for accessibility. 

## Names and pronouns

Elizabeth Stregger uses they and she pronouns. You can address me as Elizabeth (preferred) or Mx. Stregger. If you let me know what pronouns you use, I will strive to use them. I am also committed to pronouncing your name properly. I might not get it right on the first try or all the time. Please feel confident to correct me and I will work to improve. 

## Artificial Intelligence

We will not be using ChatGPT or similar artificial intelligence tools. The course and assignments were designed for your learning. The use of Artificial Intelligence is counter to the teaching and learning objectives of this course, which are based on participation, ethical sharing of information and data, self-evaluation, and trust.
