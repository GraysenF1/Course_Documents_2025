# Learning Objectives
- Principles and goals of reproducible, ethical, open, data
- using Git for reproducible version control
- TidyData
- Iteration of Data Flows
- Making Data Meaningful to Others
- Data Storage, Backup, and Security
- Ethical Considerations for Data Sharing and Re-Use
- Archiving and Preservation of Data

# Approaches to Assessment
Tracking Engagement?
Participatory Live Coding?
Formative Assessments (after Carpentries...)
Tracking GitHub Commits?
Self- or group-evaluation?
How to assign grades?

# Delivery Modalities
Initial in person set up meets.
Then likely online with Teams meeting videos stored.
  Some nights or weeks 'off' would be helpful; Elizabeth has marking end of term.
  Elizabeth can count bookable appt. hours towards Library Reference Interaction.
  
Multi-week student led projects leading to presentations?
  Advantage: self-directed
  Disadvantage: ?
  Introduce approaches with 'canned' data; let students apply with feedback.
  Student evaluation of whether data sets meet criteria.
  
Use Teams BreakOut rooms for sub-groups or trouble shooting.

# Technology(s) needed to support delivery
  GitHub as primary content repository.
  Get class list emails from Connect; get them to enter GitHub names on sheet.
  Teams for delivery + recording + transcript
  Multi-screen home setups.
  Teams is supported by IT.
  Teams video links can be listed on document on GitHub
    True live hybrid is difficult for anything other than straight lecture; someone cannot hear

  R + RStudio
  Python + Jupyter Notebook
    GoogleEarthEngine
  
Meeting I:
 'Install Week' lab sessions and/or book appt. for set up & verification     
 Motivate GitHub:
  -for open science
  -for version control

Git, GitHub;
R, RStudio
Python, Jupyter Notebook (later?)
  Why Open Data?
  Why Tidy Data?
  Data Nudism; What do You have to Hide?
  
Meeting II
  Elizabeth Research Data Life Cycle; start at the end; find & reuse data...
    What resources are accessible?
  Overview of Research Data Management
  Types, Formats, and Stages of Data
    
Meeting III    
    Accessing Stats Can data...
    Vett Lloyd Lyme Disease data set published
    Data entry errors useful to see...
  
    Then each student finds data set of interest to them
    Work through Research Data Management questions;  `
      -ex. was data set well documented

  https://openrefine.org/
  Mesoscale data with interactive tidying...
  Export script as json file for scripted, documented rerun with same column headings
  
  
Meeting IV:
  Fully scripted data handling for reproducibility and documentation with large scale data sets...
  R for Data Science Chapters 1-3
  https://r4ds.had.co.nz/
  Why Open Data?
  Why Tidy Data?

Meeting V
Remind people of Python chunks where suitable
Data Types, Workflow, and Data Transformation (R for Data Science Chapters 4-8)

Meeting VI
MetaData and File Structuring...
  Case Studies in Coordinating data from multiple sources using file naming, directory naming and meta-data catalog
  
Data Wrangling (Chapters 11, 12, 14-16)
    Iteration of Data Flows (Chapters 17-19)
    Iteration of Data Flows (Chapters 20-21)  

Meeting VII
Open Data Repositories...
  Dryad
  Pangaea

Optional Project FrameWorks
(Student choses X of Y?
Student choses independent?)

A) Importing, assembling and managing instrumental data
    Encoding issues from older instrumentation
    Interactive import (.Rmd) vs. fully scripted (.R)
   
B) Importing and using geographic data using the GoogleEarth platform

C) Webscraping through API and custom scripting

Calendar Syllabus
Data 3101 Mount Allison University  
Data Acquisition and Organization

Prereq: MATH 1311; or permission of the Program Advisor.
This course will build on MATH 1311 to cover high throughput acquisition and management of data.  
The course will use diverse data types and formats to illustrate conceptual challenges across disciplines.  
Technical aspects will include evolving approaches to script-based web scraping, file formats and conversions, data mergers and tidying, meta-data organization and capture.  
In parallel, the course will cover theoretical and ethical aspects of data curation and access policies, development of best practices for research data management and case studies in secure management of sensitive or private data.
(Format: Integrated Lecture and Laboratory 6 hours)
