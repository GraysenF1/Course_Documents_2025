# Resources

All resources for this course are either Open Access (available free online) or available through the library.

Bryan, J. (n.d.) Happy Git and GitHub for the useR. https://happygitwithr.com/index.html

Wickham, H., & G. Grolemund. (n.d.) R for data science. https://r4ds.had.co.nz/


# Learning Objectives
- Principles, motivations and goals for reproducible, ethical, open, data
- using Git for reproducible version control
- TidyData principles and practices
	-object & variable naming

- Import and tidying of diverse data sources across platforms
- Data exploration (Shiny?)
- Iteration of Data Flows
- Making Data Useful/Meaningful to Others
- Data Storage, Backup, and Security
- Ethical Considerations for Data Sharing and Re-Use
- Archiving and Preservation of Data

# Approaches to Assessment
Tracking Engagement?
Participatory Live Coding?
Formative Assessments (as in Carpentries...)
Tracking GitHub Commits?
Self- or group-evaluation?
How to assign grades?
	Consider ungrading, with initial feedback on submission leading to opportunities to improve
	Avoid initial grade assignment b/c students then ignore feedback

# Delivery Modalities
Initial (in person?) set up meets.
Then likely online with Teams meeting videos stored.
  Some nights or weeks 'off' would be helpful; Elizabeth has marking end of term & Zotero workshops etc.
  Elizabeth can count bookable appt. hours towards Library Reference Interaction.
  
Multi-week student led projects leading to presentations?
  Advantage: self-directed
  Disadvantage: time goes by; need 20% feedback by 28 Oct
  Introduce approaches with 'canned' data; let students apply with feedback.
  Student evaluation of whether data sets meet management & policy criteria.
  
Use Teams BreakOut rooms for sub-groups or trouble shooting.

# Technology(s) needed to support delivery
Moodle for Course Outline, initial survey and grade sheet  
GitHub as primary content repository.
  Get class list emails from Connect; get them to enter GitHub names through Moodle Survey
  Teams for delivery + recording + transcript
  Multi-screen home setups.
  Teams is supported by IT.
  Teams video links can be listed on document on GitHub
    True live hybrid is difficult for anything other than straight lecture; someone cannot hear

  R + RStudio
  Python + Jupyter Notebook
    GoogleEarthEngine

Question: Where to put url for general reference material?
  Toplevel in 'Course_Documents'?  on 'GitHub'?
  Limit platform proliferation and conflicts
    Doug remove url from Moodle
    Moodle ONLY for initial survey, post syllabus & gradebook
  
Git, GitHub;
R, RStudio
Python, Jupyter Notebook (later?)
  Why Open Data?
  Why Tidy Data?
  Data Nudism; What do You have to Hide?
  
Module 2 (Elizabeth):  (13) 15 Sept
  RDM: Overview & Research Data Management Lifecycle
  RDM: Finding and Reusing Data
  Introduce 2 datasets for RDM portions of the course (Tick data and StatCan data)
  
  To do: Choose a dataset of interest to you  (have some canned examples for those who need).
  You will use this dataset to practice research data management skills. Add it to your Git repository. 
    
Module 3 (Elizabeth): 20 Sept.
  
  Workshop: Cleaning data in OpenRefine (https://openrefine.org/)
  Data set: Tick Data - 2012 to 2018 
  https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/a3994d9e-ed40-fa6a-372d-f9820eae269d
  
  To do: Participate in the workshop. Formative assessment questions throughout.
  
  To do: Import a data file from the dataset you chose in Meeting 2. 
  Facet, filter, and cluster some of the columns. 
  Are there any data problems to be corrected? 
  Do you have questions about the dataset? 
  Write a summary and add it to your Git repository. 
  
  
Module 4 (Doug): 22 Sept
  Fully scripted data handling for reproducibility and documentation with large scale data sets...
  R for Data Science Chapters 1-3

Data Acquisition and Organization

Prereq: MATH 1311; or permission of the Program Advisor.
This course will build on MATH 1311 to cover high throughput acquisition and management of data.  
The course will use diverse data types and formats to illustrate conceptual challenges across disciplines.  
Technical aspects will include evolving approaches to script-based web scraping, file formats and conversions, data mergers and tidying, meta-data organization and capture.  
In parallel, the course will cover theoretical and ethical aspects of data curation and access policies, development of best practices for research data management and case studies in secure management of sensitive or private data.
(Format: Integrated Lecture and Laboratory 6 hours)
