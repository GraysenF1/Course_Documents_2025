Learning Objectives:
-Principles and goals of reproducible, ethical, open, data
-use Git for reproducible version control
-Iteration of Data Flows

Delivery Modalities:
-all classes joint in person?
-all classes separate?
-online?
-mix?
  Online fall back position in case of pandemic resurgence?
  Doug aiming to be on Campus Tues-Thurs through fall; some nights or weeks 'off' would be helpful


Possible Structures:
-multi-week student led projects leading to presentations?
  Advantage: self-directed
  Disadvantage: ?

-Elizabeth seminars + discussion on topics series?
  Coordinate with course coverage?

Calendar Syllabus
Data 3101 Mount Allison University  
Data Acquisition and Organization

Prereq: MATH 1311; or permission of the Program Advisor.
This course will build on MATH 1311 to cover high throughput acquisition and management of data.  
The course will use diverse data types and formats to illustrate conceptual challenges across disciplines.  
Technical aspects will include evolving approaches to script-based web scraping, file formats and conversions, data mergers and tidying, meta-data organization and capture.  
In parallel, the course will cover theoretical and ethical aspects of data curation and access policies, development of best practices for research data management and case studies in secure management of sensitive or private data.
(Format: Integrated Lecture and Laboratory 6 hours)
