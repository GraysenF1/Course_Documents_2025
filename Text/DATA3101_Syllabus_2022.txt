The instructors welcome diversity of origin, person, and perspective, and will strive to maintain an inclusive, welcoming environment.
Let us show kindness to each other. There will be glitches; do not panic.

We are aware of the challenges posed by mental or physical health issues. We, with the Meighen Centre, will work with students who need support.  
Students are referred to the Academic Calendar regarding:  
10.4.3 Withdrawal Without Penalty  
10.6 Academic Integrity  
10.3.2 Registration Deadlines; Students must be properly registered in a course to receive a grade on any assignment or test.

# Draft Learning Objectives  
## To be revised in light of student goals.  
At the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:  

Demonstrate in depth understanding of the principles, motivations and goals for reproducible, ethical, and open data

Use Git for communication and reproducible version control  

Import and tidy diverse data sources across platforms  

Explore data to identify potential research questions or problems in the dataset  
Identify best practices for research data management, including data organization, storage, security, sharing, and ethical re-use  
 
Demonstrate what they have learned about data acquisition, data organization, and data tools through self-reflection    

# Draft Assessment Plans  

We will use participatory live coding for some sections of this class. We will write and narrate our code as we teach and you will join in by writing and executing the same code on your computers. This allows us to learn from each other's mistakes. Throughout the sessions, we will use problems or multiple choice questions to get real-time feedback on your learning and adjust our teaching.

The sections on research data management (taught by Elizabeth) are lecture and discussion-based. Small assignments are listed under each module for you to work on throughout the term. You will add these assignments to Git and Elizabeth will provide feedback on Git. You can work through these assignments on your own timeline, but be prepared to discuss your progress at the Mid-term and Final meetings with Doug and Elizabeth.

We will attempt un-grading principles emphasizing actionable feedback.
What topics, concepts, or skills do you want to get from this course? 
We aim to use your goals to tailor the course, and to track your progress.
We seek to balance you demonstrating ability in areas where you are strong, with you developing areas where you are weaker.  

-Student self-assessment of submissions, followed by opportunity to improve work.  
-Tracking engagement, contributions and progress towards goals  
-Self-, Peer- or Group-evaluation

## Module 2: Research Data Management  
### Elizabeth:  13, 15 September  

  Overview & Research Data Management Lifecycle  
  Finding and Reusing Data  
  Introduce 2 datasets for RDM portions of the course (Tick data and StatCan data).  
 
To do: Choose a dataset of interest to you or use provided examples. You will use this dataset to practice research data management skills. Add a link to this dataset in Git. Explain why this dataset interests you.  

## Module 3: Cleaning Data in OpenRefine  
### Elizabeth: 20 Sept.  
Cleaning data in OpenRefine (https://openrefine.org/)  
  Data set: Tick Data - 2012 to 2018  
  https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/a3994d9e-ed40-fa6a-372d-f9820eae269d
 
  To do: Participate in the workshop, including asking and answering questions.
 
  To do: Import a data file from the dataset you chose in Module 2 into OpenRefine.
  Facet, filter, and cluster some of the columns.
  Are there any data problems to be corrected?
  Do you have questions about the dataset?
  Write a summary and add it to your Git repository.  
  
## Module 4: Scripted Data Import  
### Doug: 22 Sept  
Scripted data import and handling for reproducibility and documentation with large scale data sets.  

### Doug 27, 29 Sept  
Data Types, Workflow, and Data Transformation (R for Data Science Chapters 4-8)  

## 10 Sept Truth & Reconciliation Day   

## Module 5: Data Management Plans  
### Elizabeth: 4, 6 Oct  
  Data Management Plans
  Documentation & Organization
  Data Dictionary

To do: Look at the documentation accompanying the dataset you chose in Module 2. Would you be able to reuse it without asking the original researcher(s) questions? What questions do you have about the data now that you know some best practices? Would a Data Management Plan have helped? Add your thoughts in Git.  

## 10 Oct Thanksgiving Monday

### Doug: 11, 13 Oct  
Coordinating data from multiple sources using file naming, directory naming and meta-data catalog

Is there a data license for the dataset you selected? If so, what limitations exist for how you can reuse the data?
Create a citation for the dataset. Tell me which citation style you have chosen.
Add your comments to Git.

-knit report from .Rmd or Python equivalent  
-Slidy  
-PosterDown  
-Shiny Interactive Site (or Python or other Equivalent)  
-Structured Tutorial on a topic (aka Data Carpentries...)
