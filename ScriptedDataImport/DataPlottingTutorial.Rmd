## Introduction

This tutorial introduces exploratory visualization of data in R, following tidyverse principles of R for Data Science
  https://r4ds.had.co.nz/

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook, currently within a .Rproj on the RStudio.cloud server accessed through a web browser.
This gives everyone exactly the same functionality through their browser, but runs slowly; be patient!

To download a local copy of the .Rproj to run within RStudio:
-click the button beside the 'Cloud' in the 'Files' pane;
-click the 'More' gear icon
-select 'Export'
This will download a .zip file, which can be expanded to run a local version of the .Rproj.
Note that packages are not downloaded in the .zip and may have to be installed for your local version of RStudio.

When you execute code chunks by clicking a green arrow, or an option from the 'Run' pull down menu, the results appear beneath the code chunk.

Text outside chunks is not run in R.
Add new chunks by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

Libraries (or 'packages') contain additions to base R.
```{r load libraries}
library(tidyverse)
  #tidyverse set of packages for data wrangling and plotting; includes ggplot2
library(lubridate)
  #assists with date formats
```

## Project Variables
Assign project-specific values to the variables 'Project', 'DataIn', 'PlotsPath', and 'ProcessData'.
Then we can use these variables in subsequent code chunks.
```{r set project variables}
Project <- "DataTidyTutorial"
DataIn <- "DataIn"
Plots <- "Plots"
ProcessData <- "ProcessData"

```

## Import a tidied data object previously stored as .Rds object  
We could alternatively import from a .csv object
```{r read Rds}
TidyData <- readRDS(file = file.path(ProcessData, "DataTidyTutorialTidyData.Rds", fsep =.Platform$file.sep))
```

## Look at Column Names to check for non-standard names  
```{r column names}
colnames(TidyData)
```

This TidyData set has a column (variable) "Filename" which identifies the original source of the observation values in the other columns.
Other 'metadata' type columns include:  
-"Species" (the species that was tested);  

Independent Variables
-"Lincomycin" (whether or not the inhibitor Lincomycin was present during the treatment); 
-"Treatmentmin" (how many minutes of treatment were applied for a given row of observation);  
-"Treatmentue" (how many umol photons m-2 s-1 (abbreviation ue) were applied during the treatment)  

Other column categories include:  
-instrument settings for each row of observation ("ELEDA", "ADC", "PAR", "Time", etc.)

'Dependent' Variables
-measured values ( "FoF", "Fm")

Extracted Parameters
-extracted by the instrument software from the measured values ("FvFmFqFm", "FvFq", "Sigma" etc.)

## Plot "FvFmFqFm" vs. "Treatmentmin"
The 'geom_point' shows observations of the variable FvFmFqFm on the Y vs. minutes of treatment on the X.
(FvFmFqFm is... a fluorescence based metric of the activity of Photosystem II in suspensions of phytoplankton).

We pass the TidyData to the 'ggplot()' function and tell ggplot to use Treatmentmin as an x axis, and FvFmFqFm as a y axis.
Both of these variables are numeric, so we get an XY plot.
```{r plot FvFmFqFm vs Treatmentmin}
TidyData %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = Treatmentmin, y = FvFmFqFm))
```
Hmmm. FvFmFqFm shows some pattern vs. Treatment min, but there is a lot of scatter, and the data seems to fall into 'low' and 'high' groups from 150 min onwards.
```{r plot FvFmFqFm vs Species}
TidyData %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = Species, y = FvFmFqFm))
```
Hmmm.
Wide scatter within each species, but no obvious difference amongst them.
Also, 'Species' is not a numeric variable, so the X axis is now categorical.

## Plot "FvFmFqFm" vs. "Species"
The experiment was run on different species; maybe they gave very different results?

We pass the TidyData to the 'ggplot()' function and tell ggplot to use Treatmentmin as an x axis, and FvFmFqFm as a y axis.
Both of these variables are numeric, so we get an XY plot.

## Plot "FvFmFqFm" vs. "Treatmentmin" facetted by "Lincomycin"
Maybe Lincomycin = 0/1 is important; it is an inhibitor.
Segregate observations into separate columns based upon ""Lincomycin"  using 'facet_grid'.
Add a 'geom_line' to connect observations.
Add some labels.
Save the ggplot as an object, FvFmFqFmTimeLincoPlot
```{r FvFmFqFm vs Treatmentmin linco}
#ggplot2 now requires variables used for facetting to be enclosed in vars()
FvFmFqFmTimeLincoPlot <- TidyData %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = Treatmentmin, y = FvFmFqFm)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Treatmentmin, y = FvFmFqFm)) +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(Lincomycin)) + 
  labs(title = Project, subtitle = "Lincomycin (0, 1) Treatment") +
  theme_bw()

FvFmFqFmTimeLincoPlot
```
Hmmmm.
Now patterns are becoming more clear.
When Lincomycin = 0 there is a drop (with scatter) and then a later recovery. 
When Lincomycin = 1 there is a drop (exponential?) with scatter, and little recovery 
So, our exploratory plotting suggests  effects of Lincomycin and Treatmentmin on FvFmFqFm

Maybe the scatter arises from different experimental runs stored in different files?

## Plot "FvFmFqFm" vs. "Treatmentmin" facetted by "Lincomycin" and "Filename"
Segregate observations into different columns based upon "Lincomycin".
Segregate observations into different rows based upon "Filename", using 'facet_grid'.

```{r FvFmFqFm vs Treatmentmin linco files}
FvFmFqFmTimeLincoFilesPlot <- TidyData %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = Treatmentmin, y = FvFmFqFm)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Treatmentmin, y = FvFmFqFm)) +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(Lincomycin), rows = vars(Filename)) + 
  labs(title = Project, subtitle = "Lincomycin (0, 1) Treatment", caption = "Filenames by Rows") +
  theme_bw()

FvFmFqFmTimeLincoFilesPlot
```
Hmmm.
Segregating observations by Filename does not obviously influence the data patterns.
Maybe the scatter results from the three different species that were tested?

```{r Species tested}
unique(TidyData$Species)
```
## Plot "FvFmFqFm" vs. "Treatmentmin" facetted by "Lincomycin" and "Species"
Segregate observations into columns based upon "Lincomycin".
Segregate observations into rows based upon "Species".
Segregate observations by colour based upon 'Filename'.

```{r FvFmFqFm vs Treatmentmin linco species}

FvFmFqFmTimeLincoSpeciesPlot <- TidyData %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = Treatmentmin, y = FvFmFqFm, colour = Filename)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Treatmentmin, y = FvFmFqFm, colour = Filename)) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(Species), cols = vars(Lincomycin)) + 
  labs(title = Project, subtitle = "Lincomycin (0, 1) Treatment", caption = "Species by row; Filename by colour") +
  theme_bw()

FvFmFqFmTimeLincoSpeciesPlot 
```
Now we have data from each species in each row, with the originating Filename coded by colour of the points and the lines.
Lincomycin = 1 is showing a fairly clear trend, but there is still large scatter in Lincomycin = 0

Knowing the experimental design, measures were taken at two different levels of Treatmentue, which is a strong influence on the measures
```{r Treatmentue}
unique(TidyData$Treatmentue)
```
## Plot "FvFmFqFm" vs. "Treatmentmin" facetted by "Lincomycin" and "Species" with Treatmentue as colour.

```{r FvFmFqFm vs Treatmentmin linco species  Treatmentue colour}
#ggplot2 now requires variables used for facetting need to be enclosed in vars()
#Treatmentue is a numeric variable, but we want to use it as a two-level factor for ggplot colour assignment
FvFmFqFmTimeLincoSpeciesTreatmentuePlot  <- TidyData %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = Treatmentmin, y = FvFmFqFm, colour = as.factor(Treatmentue))) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Treatmentmin, y = FvFmFqFm, colour = as.factor(Treatmentue))) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(Species), cols = vars(Lincomycin)) + 
  labs(title = Project, subtitle = "Lincomycin (0, 1) Treatment", caption = "Species by row; Treatmentue by colour") +
  theme_bw()

FvFmFqFmTimeLincoSpeciesTreatmentuePlot
```
Now we see that Treatmentmin covers two different periods for Treatmentue; an initial period of 1200 umol photons m-2 s-1, and a later period of 15 umol photons m-2 s-1 (uE is an abbreviation for umol photons m-2 s-1).
Knowing the experimental design, we know that the 1500 umol photons m-2 s-1 is a high light stress period, and 15 umol photons m-2 s-1 is a subsequent low light recovery period.
But the data points  under 1200 umol photons m-2s -1 (Treatmentue) are still scattered clusters.

Examing TidyData we see that there are multiple rows of observations for each combination of:
Date x Species x Lincomycin x Treatmentmin (and x Filename)
The repeated observations are offset by small increments in the 'Time' column, which is the instrument internal clock time.
```{r repeated measures}
TidyData[1:10,1:10]
```
What if we average the data grouped into these observation combinations?

## Plot averaged "FvFmFqFm" vs. "Treatmentmin" facetted by "Lincomycin" and "Species" with Filename as colour and Treatment uE as shape.
```{r grouped average plot}
#we include Treatmentue in the group_by so it is preserved in the grouped object
#Treatmentue is a numeric variable, we use as.factor(Treatmentue) to convert it to discrete factor levels
FvFmFqFmTimeLincoSpeciesGroupPlot <- TidyData %>%
  group_by(Date, Species, Lincomycin,Treatmentmin, Treatmentue, Filename) %>%
  summarize(FvFmFqFmGroup = mean(FvFmFqFm)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = Treatmentmin, y = FvFmFqFmGroup, colour = as.factor(Filename), shape = as.factor(Treatmentue)), size = 3) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Treatmentmin, y = FvFmFqFmGroup, colour = as.factor(Filename))) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(Species), cols = vars(Lincomycin)) + 
  labs(title = Project, subtitle = "Lincomycin (0, 1) Treatment", caption = "Species by row; Treatmentue by colour") +
  theme_bw()

FvFmFqFmTimeLincoSpeciesGroupPlot
```

Now we see clear trends in the data averaged from the repeated measures.
There are small (negligible?) differences among observations taken from different Filename sources (colour coded).
This shows good reproducibility across separate runs.
  (But, scatter among the repeated measures within a Filename run)
There are strong influences of Lincomycin, that interact with Treatmentmin and with Treatmentue.
FvFmFqFmGroup drops farther under Lincomycin = 1 and Treatmentue = 1200, and then does not recover under  Lincomycin = 1 and Treatmentue = 15.

FvFmFqFmGroup drops less and plateaus under under Lincomycin = 0 and Treatmentue = 1200, and then recovers to near original levels under  Lincomycin = 0 and Treatmentue = 15 ..

## Plot filtered"FvFmFqFm" vs. "Treatmentmin" facetted by "Lincomycin" and "Species" with Filename as colour and Treatment uE as shape.

Alternately, rather than taking the average of the repeated measures, we could filter out the min and max values within each of these observation combinations.
Note we do not initially save this plot as an object.
```{r grouped filter plot}
#we include Treatmentue in the group_by so it is preserved in the grouped object
#Treatmentue is a numeric variable, we use as.factor(Treatmentue) to convert it to discrete factor levels to allow mapping symbol size to Treatmentue
TidyData %>%
  group_by(Date, Species, Lincomycin,Treatmentmin, Treatmentue, Filename) %>%
  filter(FvFmFqFm != max(FvFmFqFm)) %>%
  filter(FvFmFqFm != min(FvFmFqFm)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = Treatmentmin, y = FvFmFqFm, colour = as.factor(Filename), shape = as.factor(Treatmentue)), size = 3) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Treatmentmin, y = FvFmFqFm, colour = as.factor(Filename))) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(Species), cols = vars(Lincomycin)) + 
  labs(title = Project, subtitle = "Lincomycin (0, 1) Treatment", caption = "Species by row; Treatmentue by colour") +
  theme_bw()
```
This filtering does not change much, there seems to be a large scatter among the repeated measures.

So that is an issue for another day and deeper analyses.

## Save the exploratory plot
ggsave is part of the tidyverse
Here we use it to save the plot as a ".png" and as a ".pdf"
We can also save the ggplot object itself for later opening back into R.
ggplot objects are self-contained lists of all the data and settings needed for ggplot to regenerate the plot.
```{r save plots}
ggsave(plot = FvFmFqFmTimeLincoSpeciesGroupPlot, filename = file.path(Plots,paste(Project, "FvFmFqFmTimeLincoSpeciesGroupPlot", ".png",sep = ""), fsep = .Platform$file.sep))

ggsave(plot = FvFmFqFmTimeLincoSpeciesGroupPlot, filename = file.path(Plots,paste(Project, "FvFmFqFmTimeLincoSpeciesGroupPlot", ".pdf",sep = ""), fsep = .Platform$file.sep))

#note the slightly different wording of the code in saveRDS vs. ggsave...
saveRDS(FvFmFqFmTimeLincoSpeciesGroupPlot, file = file.path(Plots,paste(Project, "FvFmFqFmTimeLincoSpeciesGroupPlot", ".Rds",sep = ""), fsep = .Platform$file.sep))
```
Look in the 'Plots' folder to see the resulting .png, .pdf and .Rds objects.
